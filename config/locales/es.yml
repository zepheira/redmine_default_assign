  interactive_assignment_explanation: >
    When creating a new issue, the plugin can populate the assignee with the
    default assignee you've chosen above, so that it'll be visible even before
    you've created the issue. However, when you change certain fields, the form
    is reloaded and the default assignee is recalculated. This might be what you
    want, or it might be undesirable, so you can make the choice yourself:
  interactive_assignment: "Set Assignee Interactively"
  label_user: "Usuario"
  none_selected: "<None>"
